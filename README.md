# Exploring Threads in Java

I have created this repository to revise my knowledge of threads. Also, I have not worked with threads in a practical level. So, this will be a nice way to get used to using threads in future.



## Objectives

1. Understanding Threads in a better way
2. Using the special methods like sleep, wait, yield etc
3. Implementing threads with inheritance and Runnable interface
